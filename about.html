		<h3>A little more about me</h3>
		<p>
			I am originally from Barcelona Spain but I lived also in Lima, Madrid, London and Southern California. I enjoy meetting new people and learning about different cultures and societies. I used to play volleybal professionally in Spain and I still play beach volleyball tournaments in California. I also like and play tennis, basketball and raquet ball. I love to travel, live theater and live music, actually I am suscriber of South Coast Repertory, Mark Taper theater, La Jolla playhouse, and Pacific Symphony. I think of myself as someone very social and with multidirectional intellectual interests, I love a good conversation. I love animals, and I have three cats; Tigger, the eldest one with a big personality, and two little rascals Bonnie and Clyde, two rescued kittens.
