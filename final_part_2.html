			<h2>User Research</h2>

		</div>
			<h3>User Interviews</h3>
				<p>
					Since this is my last quarter at UCI, I already know people that is working in Computer Science related jobs, so I use them in every interview and research task we had to do. I also interviewed Zarko Popov (the husband of a friend, he works as a Project Manager in Western Digital) in a on every step of the project since people on his position are the main target for my portfolio.

			<h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
				<p>
					Once I found about this project, my first step was to checkout portfolios from professionals in the same field I am trying to find a job. I paid attention to how do they present themselves and their technical skills, also paid attention to the esthetic choices and styles they were using. I took notes of every detail, thinks I liked and didn’t liked on their portfolios.

			<h3>Feature Matrix</h3>
				<p>
					This stage helped me to organize which functionality apply first and in which order make the improvements to the site. 
					Was very useful to keep my self organized and focus on what is essencial first.

			<h3>Feature Prioritazion</h3>
				<p>
					It gave me a graphic representation of what should be implemented on each stage of the development

			<h2>User Testing</h2>
		</div>

			<h3>User Stories</h3>
				<p>
					The User Stories/Acceptance Criteria is where I stated what are the purposes of each section on my portfolio, and explain the goals on each section. I wanted to make them as self-explanatory as possible and test them in the Task Based Test Online stage of the project. 
				</p>

			<h3>Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>
				<p>
					For the Cognitive Walkthrough, I went again for the same people I used for the Users Interview section, since they were the perfect testing target as my portfolio is targeting people in similar positions. 
				</p>

				</button>
			</div>
			

			<h3>User Test</h3>
				<p>
					This section was one of my favorite parts, since I have to see how effective my implementation of all the previous stages and research was. I had around 10 individuals for each test and I used some of the Cognitive Walkthrough and User Interview stages, but I also used people that has not being involved in the project before so the sample test is much more heterogeneous.

			<h2>Sumary Findings and Incorporation of Findings</h2>
		</div>

			<p>
				From the Competitor Analysis I got the impression that the most successful portfolios were the simpler ones when it comes to esthetics, also, most portfolios are going for black backgrounds, the use of dark backgrounds with light color or white font is dated, and the use of panoramic pictures as a background screams “bootstrap” and since I want to promote myself for my skills at developing, I thought it was important to build it from the ground up. 
			</p>

			<p>
				From the User Interview stage, I find out that is much more important content than form, and everyone I interviewed told me that showing project it is probably the most important and effective way to promote my technical skills.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Cognitive Walkthrough allowed me to see how potential users interact with the site. I found out the site was very easy to navigate, that users really know what the site is about at first look, and that maybe I went too far in the minimalistic esthetic approach I took. Users also appreciated how responsive the web page was, and how easy adapts to different screens.
			</p>

			<p>
			The Task Based Online Test allowed me to know how effective was the first 5 seconds of exposure to the site, the conclusion I got is that every user knew immediately what was the purpose of the site, and that the presentation was extremely clean, both goals I set up for myself. The clicker test allowed me to know how self-explanatory and clear where the navigation tags. This goal was achieved too, the heat map was a clear indication that people knew where to find the information about my education, my work experience and the projects I developed in the past.
			</p>

			<p>
				The most common suggestion I got from the research was that in the esthetic department was a little too simple and lack of color, so I re-do the buttons in the contact and the project section to add a little color and three dimensions to the page. I am currently working on a footer that also have my contact information, since that will frame the content of each section better. I am also adding a little three dimensions to the content section of each page (using shades in the division borders and changing a little the color of the background around that section).
			</p>

			<p>
				The other suggestion I had from a photographer was that I should change the main picture for one where I am looking directly at the camera, since that inspire confidence to users.
			</p>

			<p>
				From the midterm, I got remarks that I wasn’t using the HTML5 tags header, section and section tags so I am working on fixing that page by page. My site has 6 html, 7 CSS and 1 JavaScript file, so it is a relatively long fixing in order to not mess up the CSS and JavaScript code when I am changing the target sections.
