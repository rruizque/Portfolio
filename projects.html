			I have done projects with C++, C#, C, JavaScript, Python, SQL, MatLab, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Dr Raquet, Prolog and Haskel. I personally like better Object Oriented laguanges. I am much more familiar with C++, Python, Java, HTML, and CSS, because I've use them more often, but I also think of myself as someone that can learn relatively fast any new language. MatLab, Prolog and Dr Raquet came really easy to me when I needed to learn them. I guess is because my love for mathematics.

			<h4>Artificial Intelligence for Connect K</h4>
			<h5>Java and Python</h5>
			<p> In collaboration with Andrew Do, we developed a Connect K console based on the game on Connect 4, but using K as a variable that can change on each new game. My function was developing the heuristics for the game strategy and decision taking and applying Alpha-Beta prunninng in order to speed up the decision taking time of the system and discard paths with low possibility of success.

All .jsp files where written between Max Paulus and myself, I wrote all the HTML part of it and some Java. I wrote all the CSS and JavaScript files.s
